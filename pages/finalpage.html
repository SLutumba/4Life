        <p>I hope you had fun doing this 'cause I had fun making it. I really wanted to make this as memorable as possible, if I did that, then this was a success.</p>
        <aside><p>(I've already been doing this but let's be official)</p></aside>
        <p>From this day forth, I vow to be a man you can be proud of. Not just today, but for the rest of your life. I promise to love, respect, and cherish what you and what we have and never let anything/anyone in between us. I promise to be your calm in the storm, your joy that comes in the morning, and your strength when you're weak. </p>
        <p>I promise to be truthful, loyal, understanding, and FOREVER

        <p>We have a long and challenging journey ahead, but I never want you to forget that I'll choose hard times with you than good times with anyone else. I'll always fight for you and our love and will do anything to make this work. Loving you is the easiest thing I've had to do in years, and I'm so happy that I met you.</p>
        <p class="love-quote"><strong>I LOVED YOU YESTERDAY, I LOVE YOU TODAY, AND I'LL LOVE YOU EVEN MORE TOMORROW.</strong></p>
